# Medical Knowledge Chatbot (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)

## Overview
This project implements a Medical Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) chatbot designed to provide educational medical information based on trusted reference documents. The system combines semantic search and large language models to generate grounded, context-aware responses. It is intended for technical demonstration, research, and learning purposes only.


## Medical Disclaimer
This application is for educational and informational purposes only. It is not intended to provide medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment. The information generated by the system should not be used as a substitute for professional medical judgment. Users should always consult qualified healthcare professionals for medical concerns.


## Features
- Retrieval-Augmented Generation pipeline for medical question answering  
- FAISS-based vector search for efficient semantic retrieval  
- Sentence-Transformers embeddings for document representation  
- Groq LLaMA 3.3 language model for response generation  
- Streamlit-based user interface for interactive querying  
- Source document attribution for retrieved context  
- Plain-text, non-decorated responses suitable for professional interfaces  


## System Architecture Overview
The system follows a standard RAG architecture:

1. Medical reference documents are embedded using Sentence-Transformers.  
2. Embeddings are stored in a FAISS vector database.  
3. User queries are embedded and matched against the vector database.  
4. Relevant context is retrieved and passed to the language model.  
5. The language model generates a response grounded in the retrieved context.  
6. Responses are presented through a Streamlit-based interface.

### Prerequisites
- Python version 3.10 or higher
- Git installed on the system
- Virtual environment support
- A valid Groq API key

### Step 1: Clone the Repository
git clone https://github.com/tsewangnamgail/Medical_Chatbot.git
cd Medical_Chatbot

python
Copy code

### Step 2: Create and Activate a Virtual Environment

macOS or Linux:
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate

makefile
Copy code

Windows:
python -m venv .venv
.venv\Scripts\activate

shell
Copy code

### Step 3: Install Dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

csharp
Copy code

### Step 4: Environment Configuration
Create a file named .env in the project root directory and add the following:
GROQ_API_KEY=your_groq_api_key_here

pgsql
Copy code

## Usage Instructions

### Step 5: Build the Vector Database
This step processes the medical reference documents and creates the FAISS vector index. It only needs to be executed once unless the source documents change.
python create_memory_for_llm.py

vbnet
Copy code

This process:
- Loads medical reference documents from the data directory
- Splits the text into manageable chunks
- Generates embeddings using Sentence-Transformers
- Stores the embeddings in a FAISS vector database

### Step 6: Run the Application

Command-line interface:
python connect_memory_with_llm.py

csharp
Copy code

Streamlit web interface:
streamlit run medibot.py

pgsql
Copy code

The Streamlit interface provides an interactive chat-based experience for querying the medical knowledge base.

## Important Notes
- The data and vectorstore directories are excluded from version control
- Ensure the vector database is created before running the chatbot
- This application is intended strictly for educational and research purposes
